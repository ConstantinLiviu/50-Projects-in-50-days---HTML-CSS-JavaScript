# 42 - LIVE USER FILTER

    Version 1.0:
    Using the API provided by randomuser.me I created a list displaying a number of users. The purpose of the project is to create a search feature that shows the users who are live and using our imaginary app/chat feature. Async/await is used instead of ".then".


    Project milestones are:
     ✔  create page structure;
    add styling;
    responsive design;
    add funtionality;
    refactor code;
    add thumbnail;

    Status:
     ✔ project in progress;
    project completed;
