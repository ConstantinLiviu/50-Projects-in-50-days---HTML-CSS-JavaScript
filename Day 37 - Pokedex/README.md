# 37 - POKEDEX

    Version 1.0:
    It's a Pokedex. (ba-dum tsss) In short, it simulates a fairly simplistic pokemon cards collection. It makes use of the Pokeapi to retrieve data which populates the pokemon cards.


    Project milestones are:
     ✔  create page structure;
     ✔  add styling;
     ✔  responsive design;
     ✔  enable API usage;
     ✔  add functionality;
     ✔  refactor code;
    add thumbnail;

    Status:
     ✔ project in progress;
    project completed;

    Possible updates:
     - generate a modal on click that expands the card and provides additional info on the pokemon in question;
     - offer a battle simulator;
     - create a minigame that allows users to draw cards and complete their collection;

    Version 2.0:
    *TBA*
