# 34 - ANIMATED COUNTDOWN

    Version 1.0:
    A countdown animation. The project was supposed to include keyframe animations and transformations but I found that a bit boring and basic. As a result I decided to change the scope of the project. It will feature less fancy transformations/animations and it will instead focus on presenting a proper transition between numbers and messages displayed on each number, as well as offer users a chance to choose the countdown range and the messages displayed during the countdown.


    Project milestones are:
     ✔  create page structure;
    add styling;
    responsive design;
    add functionality;
    enable custom messages/countdown;
    refactor code;
    add thumbnail;

    Status:
     ✔ project in progress;
    project completed;
