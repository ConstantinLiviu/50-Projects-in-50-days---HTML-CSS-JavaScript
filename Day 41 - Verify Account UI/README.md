# 41 - VERIFY ACCOUNT UI

    Version 1.0:
    This project focuses on the UI of an account verifier. It has limited functionality - numbers can be typed - but it doesn't server any other purpose.


    Project milestones are:
     ✔  create page structure;
     ✔  add styling;
     ✔  responsive design;
    add functionality;
    refactor code;
    add thumbnail;

    Status:
     ✔ project in progress;
    project completed;

    Possible updates:
     - create a code generator and have the computer verify the code upon input, generating a successful login toast message (accompanied by a simulated login) or an error message prompting to retry;

    Version 2.0:
    *TBA*
