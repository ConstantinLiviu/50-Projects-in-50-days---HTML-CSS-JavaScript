# 31 - PASSWORD GENERATOR

    Version 1.0:
    A password generator that allows the user to customize the password properties (amount and type of letters/symbols/numbers) and length
    (up to 20 characters). It also has a "copy" button.
    As it uses Math.random to generate characters it is only meant as a concept demo, not a pro password generator.
