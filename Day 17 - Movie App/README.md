# 17 - Movie App

    Version 1.0:

    A landing page that makes use of a 3rd party API (themoviedb.org) in order to create a static Netflix-like landing page. It has a functional search bar, movie info and ratings.

    To whomsoever may read this: I'm fully aware that there is no security for the API key. As this is a study project, using a burner tmdb account, security was not a priority. As I want reviewers to be able to observe and asses my work the API key was left as is; I doubt it will cause and harm or mayhem and I am sure that the tmdb team has the means to disable the key should any 3rd party abuse occur.

    Project milestones are:
     ✔  create page structure;
     ✔  add styling;
     ✔  create utility classes;
     ✔  create API consts;
     ✔  completed page functionality;
     ✔  responsive design;
     ✔  refactor code;
     ✔  add thumbnail;

    Status:
     project in progress;
     ✔ project completed;

    Possible updates:
     - redirect users to a movie trailer on youtube/other platforms;
     - fix photo not loaded cases styling;
     - fix long title words breaks;
     - allow for a more complex search system;
     - create a synopsis pop-up for mobile version;

    Version 2.0: Version 2.0: TBA
