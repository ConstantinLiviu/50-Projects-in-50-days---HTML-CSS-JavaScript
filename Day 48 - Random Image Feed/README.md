# 48 - RANDOM IMAGE FEED

    Display a random feed of images upon loading the page. Images are sourced from unsplash.com. No API is used; images are displayed using a URL to which we add a randomly generated width and height.

     ✔  create page structure;
     ✔  add styling;
     ✔  responsive design;
    add functionality;
    refactor code;
    add thumbnail;

    Status:
