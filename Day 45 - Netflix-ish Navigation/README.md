# 45 - NETFLIX-ISH NAVIGATION

    Version 1.0:
    The name of the project can be misleading as there is no technical similarity between the Netflix page and this project. This particular project displays a triple layered navbar that uses the netflix color scheme. It works both on mobile and desktop and includes a few mock menu options.

    Project milestones are:
     ✔  adjust project navbar for vertical display;
     ✔  create page structure;
     ✔  add styles;
    responsive design;
     ✔  add functionality;
    refactor code;
    add thumbnail;

    Status:
     ✔ project in progress;
    project completed;
