# 2 - Progress steps

    Version 1.0:

    Simple mini project that contains a series of 4 interconected steps forming a progress bar which responds to buttons being tapped/pressed.

    I plan to make it responsive and change the mobile funtionality to changing steps by swiping left/right instead of tapping buttons.

    Project milestones are:
     ✔ create steps list;
     ✔ create buttons;
     ✔ link steps;
     ✔ position all elements as per course design;
     - implement functionality (js);
     - refactor where necessary;
     - create mobile version;

    Status:
    Project in progress.

    Possible updates:
     - add images/diagrams/video/form/tutorial/etc. for each step ending with a "success" message after all steps are completed;
     - turn it into a "make your own adventure" game;

    Version 2.0:
    *TBD/TBA*
