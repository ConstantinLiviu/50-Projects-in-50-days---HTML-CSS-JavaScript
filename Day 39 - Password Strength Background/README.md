# 39 - Password Strength Background

    Version 1.0:
    A password strength tester; as users input a password the image unblurs. Once the password is considered strong enough the image becomes 100% clear. In this stage of the project only the length of the password is taken into cosideration when determining the strength of the password; this can be improved in the future.
