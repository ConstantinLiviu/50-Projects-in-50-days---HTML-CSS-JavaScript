# 39 - Password Strength Background

    Version 1.0:
    A password strength tester; as users input a password the image unblurs. Once the password is considered strong enough the image becomes 100% clear. In this stage of the project only the length of the password is taken into cosideration when determining the strength of the password; this can be improved in the future.


    Project milestones are:
    create page structure;
    add styiling;
    responsive design;
    add functionality;
    refactor code;
    add thumbnail;

    Status:
     ✔ project in progress;
    project completed;

    Possible updates:
     - improve the strength check by taking into account symbols, capital letters and numbers;

    Version 2.0:
    *TBA*
