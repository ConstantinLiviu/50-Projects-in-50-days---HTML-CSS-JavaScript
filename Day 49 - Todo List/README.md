# 49 - TODO LIST

    Version 1.0:
    A classic To-do project that uses local storage to maintain your list even after the page is reloaded. Using clicks, mark each task as completed or delete it from the list. It can display up to 30 tasks at once on PC and up to 15 on mobile devices (more can be added but they won't show up until previous tasks are deleted).

    Project milestones are:
     ✔  create page structure;
     ✔  add styling;
     ✔  responsive design;
     ✔  add functionality;
     ✔  local storage functionality;
     ✔  refactor code;
     ✔  add thumbnail;

    Status:
    project in progress;
     ✔ project completed;
