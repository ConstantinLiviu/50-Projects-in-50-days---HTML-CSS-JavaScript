# 2 - Rotating navigation

    Version 1.0:

    Simple mini project that contains a series of 4 interconected steps forming a progress bar which responds to buttons being tapped/pressed.

    I plan to make it responsive and change the mobile funtionality to changing steps by swiping left/right instead of tapping buttons.

    Project milestones are:
     ✔ create basic structure;
     ✔ basic styling;
     ✔ add background/hidden elements;
     ✔ add functionality;
     ✔ refactor if necessary;
     ✔ ensure responsiveness;

    Status:
     ✔ project in progress;
     ✔ project completed;

    Possible updates:
     - infinite scroll down;
     - add a 360deg dial in order to go through multiple pages/options menu/sidebar elements;

    Version 2.0:
    *TBD/TBA*
