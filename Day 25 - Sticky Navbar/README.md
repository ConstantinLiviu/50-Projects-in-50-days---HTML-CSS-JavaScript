# 25 - STICKY NAVBAR

    Version 1.0:
    As I've used a sticky navbar in every project, this one is a bit redundant. As such, I've created a basic landing page that also has a custom sticky navbar.


    Project milestones are:
     ✔  create page structure;
     ✔  update navbar;
     ✔  add styling;
     ✔  responsive design;
     ✔  add functionality;
     ✔  refactor code;
    add thumbnail;

    Status:
     ✔ project in progress;
    project completed;
