# 1 - Expanding cards

    A simple "expandable slideshow" project that makes use of css transitions and DOM manipulation.

    I plan to optimize it for both desktop and mobile devices.

    Major project steps are:
     ✔ create container and center all slides;
     ✔ add background image and make slides flexible;
     ✔ add icon and text at the bottom of each slide;
     ✔ stylize text and icon;
     ✔ make slides expandable (js);
     ✔ set transitions;
     - optimize for mobile;
