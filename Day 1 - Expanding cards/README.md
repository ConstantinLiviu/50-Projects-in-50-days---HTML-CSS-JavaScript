# 1 - Expanding cards

    Version 1.0:

    A simple "expandable slideshow" project that makes use of css transitions and DOM manipulation.

    I plan to make it responsive.

    Major project steps are:
     ✔ create container and center all slides;
     ✔ add background image and make slides flexible;
     ✔ add icon and text at the bottom of each slide;
     ✔ stylize text and icon;
     ✔ make slides expandable (js);
     ✔ set transitions;
     ✔ optimize for mobile;


    Project finished! It's reponsive (desktop and max-width: 600px screens), transitions are fluid with proper customization it can be implemented in real life projects.

    Possible updates (if time allows) :
     - grant users the option to load their own images;
     - auto switch through all slides in a loop;


    Version 2.0:
    *TBD/TBA*
