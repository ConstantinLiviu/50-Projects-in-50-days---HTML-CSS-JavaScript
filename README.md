# 50-Projects-in-50-days---HTML-CSS-JavaScript

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my work as I complete this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/

Each folder contains the files of only one mini-project and has a short descriptive title of the mini-project itself. To complete each task I used HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript. Furthermore, each folder has a readme file which offers a more detailed description of the mini-project's goal, workflow, design or any additional information I saw fit to include.
