# 19 - Theme Clock

    Version 1.0:
    A functional classic clock, displaying the time using both text and animation. It also displays the date and it has a dark mode. The page is responsive as well.


    Project milestones are:
     ✔ create page structure;
     ✔ add styling;
     ✔ create dark mode;
     ✔ add clock functionality;
     ✔ UI is responsive;
     ✔ refactor code;
    add thumbnail;

    Status:
     ✔ project in progress;
    project completed;

    Possible updates:
     - change clock type;
     - change themes button;

    Version 2.0:
     - I plan to make a different project focusing on clocks. As this project has some design quirks which I won't tackle an upgrade would be pointless.
